        <li>
          <h3>
            How quickly can I get started?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We can start scoping your needs right away. Onboarding for individuals and small teams typically begins
            within 3-5 days. Larger teams start according to an agreed-upon timeline.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            What hours do assistants work?
          </h3>
          <p>
            9:00 am – 6:00 pm Monday through Friday, per US and UK time zones, exempting federal holidays. Extended
            weekday and weekend hours may be arranged on a customized basis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            How do I provide all of my log-ins and other secure info?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We use a suite of technology and management best practices to securely enable login sharing between your
            business and T4G.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Will my assistant know how to use my tools?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes. If your assistant has not used your particular tools, our training staff will support them in learning
            it, so you don’t need to spend time training.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            What are your assistants’ qualifications?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most of our assistants have a bachelor's degree and/or extensive experience in business support services.
            Before working with our clients, every assistant goes through a month-long new-hire training program. We
            also provide ongoing training to ensure our assistants are constantly improving their skills and are
            up-to-date on the latest trends in business practices and technology.
